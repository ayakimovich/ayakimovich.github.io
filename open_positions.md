### Open PhD position: Data-driven Digital Twin of Infected Cell Dynamics on the Tissue Scale

The global SARS-CoV2 Pandemic has demonstrated the urgency to develop new tools for our arsenal against pathogens. If YOU are passionate about designing the next generation of mathematical models and algorithms in virology â€“ we are looking for YOUR talent!

Viruses require host cells to procreate and spread their progeny. For this, they enter cells, replicate and egress in a stepwise process occurring through interactions between molecules of the host cell and the pathogen molecules. These are known as host-pathogen interactions, they include various host mechanisms exploitations by the pathogen. Synchronized with virus entry, uncoating, and replication through a virus genetic program, virus induce dramatic changes of cell morphology. These may be observed in cell culture using light microscopy techniques at a moderate magnification. However, connecting the dynamics of host-pathogens interactions at cellular and tissue levels requires advanced simulations.

Using Physic-informed Neural Networks in differential equation discovery mode, as well as data-driven discriminative and generative approaches developed in our group, YOU will develop a Digital Twin model of infected cell dynamics on the scale of a tissue, which will help us understand how viruses spread across the tissue.
