 MLID group is a Young Investigator Group based in the <a href="https://casus.science">Center for Advanced Systems Understanding (CASUS)</a> of the <a href="https://hzdr.de">Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf</a>.  We are based in the beautiful German city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6rlitz">GÃ¶rlitz</a> in Germany. MLID is led by <a href="https://twitter.com/ayakimovich">Artur Yakimovich, PhD</a>.

Viruses require host cells to procreate and spread their progeny. For this, they enter cells, replicate and egress in a stepwise process occurring through interactions between molecules of the host cell and the pathogen molecules. These are known as host-pathogen interactions, they include various host mechanisms exploitations by the pathogen. Synchronized with virus entry, uncoating, and replication through a virus genetic program, virus induce dramatic changes of cell morphology. These may be observed in cell culture using light microscopy techniques at a moderate magnification. However, connecting the dynamics of host-pathogens interactions at cellular and tissue levels requires advanced simulations. 
 <br>
Recent advances in Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) are revolutionizing our abilities to analyze biomedical images and deepen our understanding of infection and disease. Among other host-pathogen interactions may be readily deciphered from microscopy data using convolutional neural networks. We work on developing the latest ML/DL and Computer Science methods to facilitate our understanding of Infection Biology and Disease Biology. This includes biomedical image analysis, generative modelling, as well as simulation of biological processes.
